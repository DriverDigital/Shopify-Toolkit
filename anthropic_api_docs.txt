The API is made available via our web Console. You can use the Workbench to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in Account Settings. Use workspaces to segment your API keys and control spend by use case.
​Authentication
All requests to the Anthropic API must include an
```
x-api-key
```
 header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.
​Content types
The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the
```
content-type: application/json
```
 header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.
​Examples
curl Python Type Script Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
     --header "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.
​Requirements to advance tier

Usage Tier | Credit Purchase | Wait After First Purchase | Max Usage per Month
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tier 1 | $5 | 0 days | $100
Tier 2 | $40 | 7 days | $500
Tier 3 | $200 | 7 days | $1,000
Tier 4 | $400 | 14 days | $5,000
Monthly Invoicing | N/A | N/A | N/A


​Updated rate limits
Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.

Claude 3 Haiku | 50 | 50,000 | 10,000


​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:

Header | Description
----------------------------------------
[CODE_BLOCK_1] | The maximum number of requests allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_2] | The number of requests remaining before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_3] | The time when the request rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_4] | The maximum number of tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_5] | The number of tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_6] | The time when the token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_7] | The maximum number of input tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_8] | The number of input tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_9] | The time when the input token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_10] | The maximum number of output tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_11] | The number of output tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_12] | The time when the output token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_13] | The number of seconds until you can retry the request.


The
```
anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-*
```
 headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model, therefore models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.
​Requirements to advance tier
[TABLE_1]
​Updated rate limits
Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.
Tier 1Tier 2Tier 3Tier 4Custom[TABLE_2]
​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:
[TABLE_3]
The [CODE_BLOCK_14] headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.

The API is made available via our web Console. You can use the Workbench to try out the API in the browser and then generate API keys in Account Settings. Use workspaces to segment your API keys and control spend by use case.
​Authentication
All requests to the Anthropic API must include an
```
x-api-key
```
 header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.
​Content types
The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the
```
content-type: application/json
```
 header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.
​Examples
curl Python Type Script Shell
```
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
     --header "x-api-key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \

​Authentication
All requests to the Anthropic API must include an [CODE_BLOCK_1] header with your API key. If you are using the Client SDKs, you will set the API when constructing a client, and then the SDK will send the header on your behalf with every request. If integrating directly with the API, you’ll need to send this header yourself.
​Content types
The Anthropic API always accepts JSON in request bodies and returns JSON in response bodies. You will need to send the [CODE_BLOCK_2] header in requests. If you are using the Client SDKs, this will be taken care of automatically.
​Examples
curl Python Type Script Shell[CODE_BLOCK_3]Shell[CODE_BLOCK_3]

Our API follows a predictable HTTP error code format:

400 -
```
invalid_request_error
```
: There was an issue with the format or content of your request. We may also use this error type for other 4XX status codes not listed below.
401 -
```
authentication_error
```
: There’s an issue with your API key.
403 -
```
permission_error
```
: Your API key does not have permission to use the specified resource.
404 -
```
not_found_error
```
: The requested resource was not found.
413 -
```
request_too_large
```
: Request exceeds the maximum allowed number of bytes.
429 -
```
rate_limit_error
```
: Your account has hit a rate limit.
500 -
```
api_error
```
: An unexpected error has occurred internal to Anthropic’s systems.
529 -
```
overloaded_error
```
: Anthropic’s API is temporarily overloaded.

When receiving a streaming response via SSE, it’s possible that an error can occur after returning a 200 response, in which case error handling wouldn’t follow these standard mechanisms.
​Error shapes
Errors are always returned as JSON, with a top-level
```
error
```
 object that always includes a
```
type
```
 and
```
message
```
 value. For example:
JSON
```
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "not_found_error",
    "message": "The requested resource could not be found."
  }
}
```

In accordance with our versioning policy, we may expand the values within these objects, and it is possible that the
```

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.
​Requirements to advance tier

Usage Tier | Credit Purchase | Wait After First Purchase | Max Usage per Month
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tier 1 | $5 | 0 days | $100
Tier 2 | $40 | 7 days | $500
Tier 3 | $200 | 7 days | $1,000
Tier 4 | $400 | 14 days | $5,000
Monthly Invoicing | N/A | N/A | N/A


​Updated rate limits
Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.

​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:

Header | Description
----------------------------------------
[CODE_BLOCK_1] | The maximum number of requests allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_2] | The number of requests remaining before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_3] | The time when the request rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_4] | The maximum number of tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_5] | The number of tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_6] | The time when the token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_7] | The maximum number of input tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_8] | The number of input tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_9] | The time when the input token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_10] | The maximum number of output tokens allowed within any rate limit period.
[CODE_BLOCK_11] | The number of output tokens remaining (rounded to the nearest thousand) before being rate limited.
[CODE_BLOCK_12] | The time when the output token rate limit will reset, provided in RFC 3339 format.
[CODE_BLOCK_13] | The number of seconds until you can retry the request.


The
```
anthropic-ratelimit-tokens-*
```
 headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.

Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.

​Updated rate limits
Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.

​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:
[TABLE_3]
The [CODE_BLOCK_14] headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.

Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:
[TABLE_3]
The [CODE_BLOCK_14] headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model, therefore models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.
Tier 1Tier 2Tier 3Tier 4Custom[TABLE_4]Errors Client SDKsxlinkedin We have two types of limits:

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.
​Requirements to advance tier

​Updated rate limits
Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.
Tier 1Tier 2Tier 3Tier 4Custom[TABLE_2]
​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:
[TABLE_3]
The [CODE_BLOCK_14] headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.

 headers display the values for the most restrictive limit currently in effect. For example, if you have exceeded the Workspace per-minute token limit, the headers will contain the Workspace per-minute token rate limit values. If Workspace limits do not apply, the headers will return the total tokens remaining, where total is the sum of input and output tokens. This approach ensures that you have visibility into the most relevant constraint on your current API usage.
​Legacy rate limits
Our rate limits were previously measured in requests per minute, tokens per minute, and tokens per day for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model, therefore models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.

Spend limits set a maximum monthly cost an organization can incur for API usage.
Rate limits set the maximum number of API requests an organization can make over a defined period of time.

We enforce service-configured limits at the organization level, but you may also set user-configurable limits for your organization’s workspaces.
​About our limits

Limits are designed to prevent API abuse, while minimizing impact on common customer usage patterns.
Limits are defined by usage tier, where each tier is associated with a different set of spend and rate limits.
Your organization will increase tiers automatically as you reach certain thresholds while using the API.
Limits are set at the organization level. You can see your organization’s limits in the Limits page in the Anthropic Console.
You may hit rate limits over shorter time intervals. For instance, a rate of 60 requests per minute (RPM) may be enforced as 1 request per second. Short bursts of requests at a high volume can surpass the rate limit and result in rate limit errors.
The limits outlined below are our standard limits. If you’re seeking higher, custom limits, contact sales through the Anthropic Console.
We use the token bucket algorithm to do rate limiting.
All limits described here represent maximum allowed usage, not guaranteed minimums. These limits are designed to prevent overuse and ensure fair distribution of resources among users.

​Spend limits
Each usage tier has a limit on how much you can spend on the API each calendar month. Once you reach the spend limit of your tier, until you qualify for the next tier, you will have to wait until the next month to be able to use the API again.
To qualify for the next tier, you must meet a deposit requirement and a mandatory wait period. Higher tiers require longer wait periods. Note, to minimize the risk of overfunding your account, you cannot deposit more than your monthly spend limit.

Our rate limits are measured in requests per minute, input tokens per minute, and output tokens per minute for each model class. If you exceed any of the rate limits you will get a 429 error. Click on the rate limit tier to view relevant rate limits.
Rate limits are tracked per model. Therefore, models within the same tier do not share a rate limit.
Tier 1Tier 2Tier 3Tier 4Custom[TABLE_2]
​Setting lower limits for Workspaces
In order to protect Workspaces in your Organization from potential overuse, you can set custom spend and rate limits per Workspace.
Example: If your Organization’s limit is 48,000 tokens per minute (40,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens), you might limit one Workspace to 30,000 total tokens per minute. This protects other Workspaces from potential overuse and ensures a more equitable distribution of resources across your Organization. The remaining unused tokens per minute (or more, if that Workspace doesn’t use the limit) are then available for other Workspaces to use.
Note:

You can’t set limits on the default Workspace.
If not set, Workspace limits match the Organization’s limit.
Organization-wide limits always apply, even if Workspace limits add up to more.
Support for input and output token limits will be added to Workspaces in the future.

​Response headers
The API response includes headers that show you the rate limit enforced, current usage, and when the limit will be reset.
The following headers are returned:

See models for additional details and options.messagesobject[]required Input messages.
Our models are trained to operate on alternating
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 conversational turns. When creating a new
```
Message
```
, you specify the prior conversational turns with the
```
messages
```
 parameter, and the model then generates the next
```
Message
```
 in the conversation. Consecutive
```
user
```
 or
```
assistant
```
 turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
Each input message must be an object with a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
. You can specify a single
```
user
```
-role message, or you can include multiple
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 messages.
If the final message uses the
```
assistant
```
 role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.
Example with a single
```
user
```
 message:

```
[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
```

Example with multiple conversational turns:

```
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
]
```

Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

```
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
]
```

Each input message
```
content
```
 may be either a single
```
string
```
 or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific
```
type
```
. Using a
```
string
```
 for
```
content
```
 is shorthand for an array of one content block of type
```
"text"
```
. The following input messages are equivalent:

```
{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
```


```
{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
```

Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

```
{"role": "user", "content": [
  {
    "type": "image",
    "source": {
      "type": "base64",
      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
    }
  },
  {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
]}
```

We currently support the
```
base64
```
 source type for images, and the
```
image/jpeg
```
,
```
image/png
```
,
```
image/gif
```
, and
```
image/webp
```
 media types.
See examples for more input examples.

```

```
"system"
```
 role for input messages in the Messages API.Show child attributesmax_tokensintegerrequired The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.

If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the

, the results will not be fully deterministic.tool_choiceobject How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool, any available tool, or decide by itself.Auto Any Tool Show child attributestoolsobject[]Definitions of tools that the model may use.
If you include
```
tools
```
 in your API request, the model may return
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using
```
tool_result
```
 content blocks.
Each tool definition includes:


```
name
```
: Name of the tool.

```
description
```
: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.

```
input_schema
```
: JSON schema for the tool
```
input
```
 shape that the model will produce in
```
tool_use
```
 output content blocks.

For example, if you defined
```
tools
```
 as:

```
[
  {
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "description": "Get the current stock price for a given ticker symbol.",
    "input_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "ticker": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The stock ticker symbol, e.g. AAPL for Apple Inc."
        }
      },
      "required": ["ticker"]
    }
  }
]
```

And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks in the response like this:

```
[
  {
    "type": "tool_use",
    "id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
    "name": "get_stock_price",
    "input": { "ticker": "^GSPC" }
  }
]
```

You might then run your
```
get_stock_price
```
 tool with
```
{"ticker": "^GSPC"}
```
 as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent
```
user
```
 message:

```
[
  {
    "type": "tool_result",
    "tool_use_id": "toolu_01D7FLrfh4GYq7yT1ULFeyMV",
    "content": "259.75 USD"
  }
]
```

Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

See models for additional details and options.messagesobject[]required Input messages.
Our models are trained to operate on alternating [CODE_BLOCK_2] and [CODE_BLOCK_3] conversational turns. When creating a new [CODE_BLOCK_4], you specify the prior conversational turns with the [CODE_BLOCK_5] parameter, and the model then generates the next [CODE_BLOCK_6] in the conversation. Consecutive [CODE_BLOCK_7] or [CODE_BLOCK_8] turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
Each input message must be an object with a [CODE_BLOCK_9] and [CODE_BLOCK_10]. You can specify a single [CODE_BLOCK_11]-role message, or you can include multiple [CODE_BLOCK_12] and [CODE_BLOCK_13] messages.
If the final message uses the [CODE_BLOCK_14] role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.
Example with a single [CODE_BLOCK_15] message:
[CODE_BLOCK_16]
Example with multiple conversational turns:
[CODE_BLOCK_18]
Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:
[CODE_BLOCK_20]
Each input message [CODE_BLOCK_22] may be either a single [CODE_BLOCK_23] or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific [CODE_BLOCK_24]. Using a [CODE_BLOCK_25] for [CODE_BLOCK_26] is shorthand for an array of one content block of type [CODE_BLOCK_27]. The following input messages are equivalent:
[CODE_BLOCK_28]
[CODE_BLOCK_30]
Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:
[CODE_BLOCK_32]
We currently support the [CODE_BLOCK_34] source type for images, and the [CODE_BLOCK_35], [CODE_BLOCK_36], [CODE_BLOCK_37], and [CODE_BLOCK_38] media types.
See examples for more input examples.
Note that if you want to include a system prompt, you can use the top-level [CODE_BLOCK_39] parameter — there is no [CODE_BLOCK_40] role for input messages in the Messages API.Show child attributesmax_tokensintegerrequired The maximum number of tokens to generate before stopping.
Note that our models may stop before reaching this maximum. This parameter only specifies the absolute maximum number of tokens to generate.
Different models have different maximum values for this parameter.  See models for details.metadataobject An object describing metadata about the request.Show child attributesstop_sequencesstring[]Custom text sequences that will cause the model to stop generating.
Our models will normally stop when they have naturally completed their turn, which will result in a response [CODE_BLOCK_41] of [CODE_BLOCK_42].
If you want the model to stop generating when it encounters custom strings of text, you can use the [CODE_BLOCK_43] parameter. If the model encounters one of the custom sequences, the response [CODE_BLOCK_44] value will be [CODE_BLOCK_45] and the response [CODE_BLOCK_46] value will contain the matched stop sequence.streamboolean Whether to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events.
See streaming for details.systemstringobject[]System prompt.
A system prompt is a way of providing context and instructions to Claude, such as specifying a particular goal or role. See our guide to system prompts.temperaturenumber Amount of randomness injected into the response.
Defaults to [CODE_BLOCK_47]. Ranges from [CODE_BLOCK_48] to [CODE_BLOCK_49]. Use [CODE_BLOCK_50] closer to [CODE_BLOCK_51] for analytical / multiple choice, and closer to [CODE_BLOCK_52] for creative and generative tasks.
Note that even with [CODE_BLOCK_53] of [CODE_BLOCK_54], the results will not be fully deterministic.tool_choiceobject How the model should use the provided tools. The model can use a specific tool, any available tool, or decide by itself.Auto Any Tool Show child attributestoolsobject[]Definitions of tools that the model may use.
If you include [CODE_BLOCK_55] in your API request, the model may return [CODE_BLOCK_56] content blocks that represent the model's use of those tools. You can then run those tools using the tool input generated by the model and then optionally return results back to the model using [CODE_BLOCK_57] content blocks.
Each tool definition includes:

[CODE_BLOCK_58]: Name of the tool.
[CODE_BLOCK_59]: Optional, but strongly-recommended description of the tool.
[CODE_BLOCK_60]: JSON schema for the tool [CODE_BLOCK_61] shape that the model will produce in [CODE_BLOCK_62] output content blocks.

For example, if you defined [CODE_BLOCK_63] as:
[CODE_BLOCK_64]
And then asked the model "What's the S&P 500 at today?", the model might produce [CODE_BLOCK_66] content blocks in the response like this:
[CODE_BLOCK_67]
You might then run your [CODE_BLOCK_69] tool with [CODE_BLOCK_70] as an input, and return the following back to the model in a subsequent [CODE_BLOCK_71] message:
[CODE_BLOCK_72]
Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.

In nucleus sampling, we compute the cumulative distribution over all the options for each subsequent token in decreasing probability order and cut it off once it reaches a particular probability specified by [CODE_BLOCK_75]. You should either alter [CODE_BLOCK_76] or [CODE_BLOCK_77], but not both.

Example:
[CODE_BLOCK_84]
If the request input [CODE_BLOCK_86] ended with an [CODE_BLOCK_87] turn, then the response [CODE_BLOCK_88] will continue directly from that last turn. You can use this to constrain the model's output.
For example, if the input [CODE_BLOCK_89] were:
[CODE_BLOCK_90]
Then the response [CODE_BLOCK_92] might be:
[CODE_BLOCK_93]Text Tool Use Show child attributesmodelstringrequired The model that handled the request.stop_reasonenum<string> | nullrequired The reason that we stopped.
This may be one the following values:

[CODE_BLOCK_98]: one of your provided custom [CODE_BLOCK_99] was generated

Future models and features will require use of the Messages API, and we recommend migrating as soon as possible.
The Anthropic API performs basic prompt sanitization and validation to help ensure that your prompts are well-formatted for Claude.
When creating Text Completions, if your prompt is not in the specified format, the API will first attempt to lightly sanitize it (for example, by removing trailing spaces). This exact behavior is subject to change, and we strongly recommend that you format your prompts with the recommended alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns.
Then, the API will validate your prompt under the following conditions:

The first conversational turn in the prompt must be a
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn
The last conversational turn in the prompt be an
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turn
The prompt must be less than
```
100,000 - 1
```
 tokens in length.

​Examples
The following prompts will results in API errors:
Python
```
# Missing "\n\nHuman:" and "\n\nAssistant:" turns
prompt = "Hello, world"

# Missing "\n\nHuman:" turn
prompt = "Hello, world\n\nAssistant:"

# Missing "\n\nAssistant:" turn
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude"

# "\n\nHuman:" turn is not first
prompt = "\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"

# "\n\nAssistant:" turn is not last
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: How many toes do dogs have?"

# "\n\nAssistant:" only has one "\n"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude \nAssistant:"
```

The following are currently accepted and automatically sanitized by the API, but you should not rely on this behavior, as it may change in the future:
Python
```
# No leading "\n\n" for "\n\nHuman:"
prompt = "Human: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"

# Trailing space after "\n\nAssistant:"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude:\n\nAssistant: "
```

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
.
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns, but the Messages API expects
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the
```
completion
```
 values of the response:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the
```
content
```
 value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the
```
assistant
```
 role:
Python
```
messages = [
  {"role": "human", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, my name is"},
]
```

When doing so, response
```
content
```
 will continue from the last input message
```
content
```
:
JSON
```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn:
Python
```
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the
```
system
```
 parameter:
Python
```
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g.
```
claude-3-opus-20240229
```
).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g.
```
claude-2
```
), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of either:


```
"stop_sequence"
```
: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: Either the model generated your specified
```
max_tokens
```
 of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of one of the following values:


```
"end_turn"
```
: The conversational turn ended naturally.

```
"stop_sequence"
```
: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions:
```
max_tokens_to_sample
```
 parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages:
```
max_tokens
```
 parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using
```
"stream": true
```
 in with Text Completions, the response included any of
```
completion
```
,
```
ping
```
, and
```
error
```
 server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.
Messages can contain multiple content blocks of varying types, and so its streaming format is somewhat more complex.

```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:

 message:

```

Tools can be used for workflows that include running client-side tools and functions, or more generally whenever you want the model to produce a particular JSON structure of output.
See our guide for more details.Tool Computer Use Tool_20241022Bash Tool_20241022Text Editor_20241022Show child attributesmessagesobject[]required Input messages.
Our models are trained to operate on alternating
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 conversational turns. When creating a new
```
Message
```
, you specify the prior conversational turns with the
```
messages
```
 parameter, and the model then generates the next
```
Message
```
 in the conversation. Consecutive
```
user
```
 or
```
assistant
```
 turns in your request will be combined into a single turn.
Each input message must be an object with a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
. You can specify a single
```
user
```
-role message, or you can include multiple
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 messages.
If the final message uses the
```
assistant
```
 role, the response content will continue immediately from the content in that message. This can be used to constrain part of the model's response.
Example with a single
```
user
```
 message:

```
[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}]
```

Example with multiple conversational turns:

```
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Hello there."},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help you?"},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain LLMs in plain English?"},
]
```

Example with a partially-filled response from Claude:

```
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "What's the Greek name for Sun? (A) Sol (B) Helios (C) Sun"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "The best answer is ("},
]
```

Each input message
```
content
```
 may be either a single
```
string
```
 or an array of content blocks, where each block has a specific
```
type
```
. Using a
```
string
```
 for
```
content
```
 is shorthand for an array of one content block of type
```
"text"
```
. The following input messages are equivalent:

```
{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
```


```
{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Hello, Claude"}]}
```

Starting with Claude 3 models, you can also send image content blocks:

```
{"role": "user", "content": [
  {
    "type": "image",
    "source": {
      "type": "base64",
      "media_type": "image/jpeg",
      "data": "/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...",
    }
  },
  {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?"}
]}
```

We currently support the
```
base64
```
 source type for images, and the
```
image/jpeg
```
,
```
image/png
```
,
```
image/gif
```
, and
```
image/webp
```
 media types.
See examples for more input examples.
Note that if you want to include a system prompt, you can use the top-level
```

```
 parameter — there is no
```
"system"
```

```
"stream": true
```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A
```
tool_use
```
 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A
```
message_start
```
 event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A
```
content_block_start
```
 event
b. Potentially multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events
c. A
```
content_block_stop
```
 event
A
```
message_delta
```
 event
A
```
message_stop
```
 event

There may be
```
ping
```
 events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.
​Basic streaming request
Request[CODE_BLOCK_43]
Response[CODE_BLOCK_45]
​Streaming request with tool use
In this request, we ask Claude to use a tool to tell us the weather.
Request[CODE_BLOCK_47]
Response[CODE_BLOCK_49]Count Message tokens (beta)Migrating from Text Completionsxlinkedin When creating a Message, you can set [CODE_BLOCK_1] to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].

One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.

Future models and features will require use of the Messages API, and we recommend migrating as soon as possible.
The Anthropic API performs basic prompt sanitization and validation to help ensure that your prompts are well-formatted for Claude.
When creating Text Completions, if your prompt is not in the specified format, the API will first attempt to lightly sanitize it (for example, by removing trailing spaces). This exact behavior is subject to change, and we strongly recommend that you format your prompts with the recommended alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns.
Then, the API will validate your prompt under the following conditions:

The first conversational turn in the prompt must be a
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn
The last conversational turn in the prompt be an
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turn
The prompt must be less than
```
100,000 - 1
```
 tokens in length.

​Examples
The following prompts will results in API errors:
Python
```
# Missing "\n\nHuman:" and "\n\nAssistant:" turns
prompt = "Hello, world"

# Missing "\n\nHuman:" turn
prompt = "Hello, world\n\nAssistant:"

# Missing "\n\nAssistant:" turn
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude"

# "\n\nHuman:" turn is not first
prompt = "\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"

# "\n\nAssistant:" turn is not last
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant: Hello, world\n\nHuman: How many toes do dogs have?"

# "\n\nAssistant:" only has one "\n"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude \nAssistant:"
```

The following are currently accepted and automatically sanitized by the API, but you should not rely on this behavior, as it may change in the future:
Python
```
# No leading "\n\n" for "\n\nHuman:"
prompt = "Human: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"

# Trailing space after "\n\nAssistant:"
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude:\n\nAssistant: "

​Polling for Message Batch completion
To poll a Message Batch, you’ll need its
```
id
```
, which is provided in the response when creating request or by listing batches. Example
```
id
```
:
```
msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF
```
.

}
{
  "id": "msgbatch_01HkcTjaV5uDC8jWR4ZsDV8d",
  "type": "message_batch",
  ...
}
```

​Retrieving Message Batch Results
Once your Message Batch status is
```
ended
```
, you will be able to view the
```
results_url
```
 of the batch and retrieve results in the form of a
```

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
.
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns, but the Messages API expects
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the
```
completion
```
 values of the response:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the
```
content
```
 value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the
```
assistant
```
 role:
Python
```
messages = [
  {"role": "human", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, my name is"},
]
```

When doing so, response
```
content
```
 will continue from the last input message
```
content
```
:
JSON
```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn:
Python
```
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the
```
system
```
 parameter:
Python
```
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g.
```
claude-3-opus-20240229
```
).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g.
```
claude-2
```
), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of either:


```
"stop_sequence"
```
: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: Either the model generated your specified
```
max_tokens
```
 of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of one of the following values:


```
"end_turn"
```
: The conversational turn ended naturally.

```
"stop_sequence"
```
: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions:
```
max_tokens_to_sample
```
 parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages:
```
max_tokens
```
 parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using
```
"stream": true
```
 in with Text Completions, the response included any of
```
completion
```
,
```
ping
```
, and
```
error
```
 server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.
Messages can contain multiple content blocks of varying types, and so its streaming format is somewhat more complex.

```
:
JSON
```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn:
Python
```
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the
```
system
```
 parameter:
Python
```
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g.
```
claude-3-opus-20240229
```
).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g.
```
claude-2
```
), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of either:


```
"stop_sequence"
```
: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: Either the model generated your specified
```
max_tokens
```
 of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of one of the following values:


```
"end_turn"
```
: The conversational turn ended naturally.

```
"stop_sequence"
```
: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions:
```
max_tokens_to_sample
```
 parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages:
```
max_tokens
```
 parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using
```
"stream": true
```
 in with Text Completions, the response included any of
```
completion
```
,
```
ping
```
, and
```
error
```
 server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.
Messages can contain multiple content blocks of varying types, and so its streaming format is somewhat more complex.

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_1]
With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a [CODE_BLOCK_3] and [CODE_BLOCK_4].
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating [CODE_BLOCK_5] and [CODE_BLOCK_6] turns, but the Messages API expects [CODE_BLOCK_7] and [CODE_BLOCK_8] roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the [CODE_BLOCK_9] values of the response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_10]
With Messages, the response is the [CODE_BLOCK_12] value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_13]
​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_15]
With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the [CODE_BLOCK_17] role:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_18]
When doing so, response [CODE_BLOCK_20] will continue from the last input message [CODE_BLOCK_21]:
JSON[CODE_BLOCK_22]
​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first [CODE_BLOCK_24] turn:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_25]
With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the [CODE_BLOCK_27] parameter:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_28]
​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_30]).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_31]), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a [CODE_BLOCK_32] of either:

[CODE_BLOCK_33]: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_34]: Either the model generated your specified [CODE_BLOCK_35] of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a [CODE_BLOCK_36] of one of the following values:

[CODE_BLOCK_37]: The conversational turn ended naturally.
[CODE_BLOCK_38]: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_39]: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions: [CODE_BLOCK_40] parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages: [CODE_BLOCK_41] parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
.
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating
```
\n\nHuman:

```
 roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the
```
completion
```
 values of the response:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the

```
 value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_1]
With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a [CODE_BLOCK_3] and [CODE_BLOCK_4].
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating [CODE_BLOCK_5] and [CODE_BLOCK_6] turns, but the Messages API expects [CODE_BLOCK_7] and [CODE_BLOCK_8] roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the [CODE_BLOCK_9] values of the response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_10]
With Messages, the response is the [CODE_BLOCK_12] value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_13]
​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_15]
With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the [CODE_BLOCK_17] role:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_18]
When doing so, response [CODE_BLOCK_20] will continue from the last input message [CODE_BLOCK_21]:
JSON[CODE_BLOCK_22]
​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first [CODE_BLOCK_24] turn:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_25]
With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the [CODE_BLOCK_27] parameter:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_28]
​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_30]).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_31]), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a [CODE_BLOCK_32] of either:

[CODE_BLOCK_33]: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_34]: Either the model generated your specified [CODE_BLOCK_35] of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a [CODE_BLOCK_36] of one of the following values:

[CODE_BLOCK_37]: The conversational turn ended naturally.
[CODE_BLOCK_38]: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_39]: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions: [CODE_BLOCK_40] parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages: [CODE_BLOCK_41] parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using [CODE_BLOCK_42] in with Text Completions, the response included any of [CODE_BLOCK_43], [CODE_BLOCK_44], and [CODE_BLOCK_45] server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
.
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns, but the Messages API expects
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the
```
completion
```
 values of the response:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the
```
content
```
 value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the
```
assistant
```
 role:
Python
```
messages = [
  {"role": "human", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, my name is"},
]
```

When doing so, response
```
content
```
 will continue from the last input message
```
content
```
:
JSON
```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn:
Python
```
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the
```
system
```
 parameter:
Python
```
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g.
```
claude-3-opus-20240229
```
).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g.
```
claude-2
```
), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of either:


```
"stop_sequence"
```
: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: Either the model generated your specified
```
max_tokens
```
 of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of one of the following values:


```
"end_turn"
```
: The conversational turn ended naturally.

```
"stop_sequence"
```
: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions:
```
max_tokens_to_sample
```
 parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages:
```
max_tokens
```
 parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using
```
"stream": true
```
 in with Text Completions, the response included any of
```

[CODE_BLOCK_37]: The conversational turn ended naturally.
[CODE_BLOCK_38]: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_39]: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions: [CODE_BLOCK_40] parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages: [CODE_BLOCK_41] parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using [CODE_BLOCK_42] in with Text Completions, the response included any of [CODE_BLOCK_43], [CODE_BLOCK_44], and [CODE_BLOCK_45] server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.
Messages can contain multiple content blocks of varying types, and so its streaming format is somewhat more complex. See Messages streaming for details.Streaming Messages Messages examplesxlinkedin When migrating from from Text Completions to Messages, consider the following changes.
​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_1]
With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a [CODE_BLOCK_3] and [CODE_BLOCK_4].
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating [CODE_BLOCK_5] and [CODE_BLOCK_6] turns, but the Messages API expects [CODE_BLOCK_7] and [CODE_BLOCK_8] roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the [CODE_BLOCK_9] values of the response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_10]
With Messages, the response is the [CODE_BLOCK_12] value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_13]
​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_15]
With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the [CODE_BLOCK_17] role:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_18]
When doing so, response [CODE_BLOCK_20] will continue from the last input message [CODE_BLOCK_21]:
JSON[CODE_BLOCK_22]
​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first [CODE_BLOCK_24] turn:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_25]
With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the [CODE_BLOCK_27] parameter:
Python[CODE_BLOCK_28]
​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_30]).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_31]), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a [CODE_BLOCK_32] of either:

[CODE_BLOCK_33]: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_34]: Either the model generated your specified [CODE_BLOCK_35] of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a [CODE_BLOCK_36] of one of the following values:

[CODE_BLOCK_37]: The conversational turn ended naturally.
[CODE_BLOCK_38]: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.
[CODE_BLOCK_39]: (unchanged)

​Inputs and outputs
The largest change between Text Completions and the Messages is the way in which you specify model inputs and receive outputs from the model.
With Text Completions, inputs are raw strings:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello there\n\nAssistant: Hi, I'm Claude. How can I help?\n\nHuman: Can you explain Glycolysis to me?\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify a list of input messages instead of a raw prompt:

Each input message has a
```
role
```
 and
```
content
```
.
Role names The Text Completions API expects alternating
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 and
```
\n\nAssistant:
```
 turns, but the Messages API expects
```
user
```
 and
```
assistant
```
 roles. You may see documentation referring to either “human” or “user” turns. These refer to the same role, and will be “user” going forward.
With Text Completions, the model’s generated text is returned in the
```
completion
```
 values of the response:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.completions.create(...)
>>> response.completion
" Hi, I'm Claude"
```

With Messages, the response is the
```
content
```
 value, which is a list of content blocks:
Python
```
>>> response = anthropic.messages.create(...)
>>> response.content
[{"type": "text", "text": "Hi, I'm Claude"}]
```

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
With Text Completions, you can pre-fill part of Claude’s response:
Python
```
prompt = "\n\nHuman: Hello\n\nAssistant: Hello, my name is"
```

With Messages, you can achieve the same result by making the last input message have the
```
assistant
```
 role:
Python
```
messages = [
  {"role": "human", "content": "Hello"},
  {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, my name is"},
]
```

When doing so, response
```
content
```
 will continue from the last input message
```
content
```
:
JSON
```
{
  "role": "assistant",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": " Claude. How can I assist you today?" }],
  ...
}
```

​System prompt
With Text Completions, the system prompt is specified by adding text before the first
```
\n\nHuman:
```
 turn:
Python
```
prompt = "Today is January 1, 2024.\n\nHuman: Hello, Claude\n\nAssistant:"
```

With Messages, you specify the system prompt with the
```
system
```
 parameter:
Python
```
anthropic.Anthropic().messages.create(
    model="claude-3-opus-20240229",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system="Today is January 1, 2024.", # <-- system prompt
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}
    ]
)
```

​Model names
The Messages API requires that you specify the full model version (e.g.
```
claude-3-opus-20240229
```
).
We previously supported specifying only the major version number (e.g.
```
claude-2
```
), which resulted in automatic upgrades to minor versions. However, we no longer recommend this integration pattern, and Messages do not support it.
​Stop reason
Text Completions always have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of either:


```
"stop_sequence"
```
: The model either ended its turn naturally, or one of your custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: Either the model generated your specified
```
max_tokens
```
 of content, or it reached its absolute maximum.

Messages have a
```
stop_reason
```
 of one of the following values:


```
"end_turn"
```
: The conversational turn ended naturally.

```
"stop_sequence"
```
: One of your specified custom stop sequences was generated.

```
"max_tokens"
```
: (unchanged)

​Specifying max tokens

Text Completions:
```
max_tokens_to_sample
```
 parameter. No validation, but capped values per-model.
Messages:
```
max_tokens
```
 parameter. If passing a value higher than the model supports, returns a validation error.

​Streaming format
When using
```
"stream": true
```
 in with Text Completions, the response included any of
```
completion
```
,
```
ping
```
, and
```
error
```
 server-sent-events. See Text Completions streaming for details.

Anthropic home page English Search...Go to claude.ai Research News Go to claude.ai Search...Navigation Messages Streaming Messages Welcome User Guides API Reference Prompt Library Release Notes Developer Newsletter Developer Console Developer Discord Support Using the APIGetting started IP addresses Versions Errors Rate limits Client SDKs Supported regions Getting help Anthropic APIs Messages POSTCreate a Message POSTCount Message tokens (beta)Streaming Messages Migrating from Text Completions Messages examples Message Batches (beta)Text Completions (legacy)Amazon Bedrock APIAmazon Bedrock APIVertex AIVertex AI APIMessages Streaming Messages When creating a Message, you can set
```
"stream": true
```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A
```
tool_use
```
 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A
```
message_start
```
 event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A
```
content_block_start
```
 event
b. Potentially multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events
c. A
```
content_block_stop
```
 event
A
```
message_delta
```
 event
A
```
message_stop
```
 event

There may be
```
ping
```
 events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A
```
tool_use

 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```

We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
"stream": true
```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A

tool_use

 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A

 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple

​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple

We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
"stream": true
```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A
```
tool_use
```
 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta

 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```

```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```

​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g. [CODE_BLOCK_2]), and include the matching event [CODE_BLOCK_3] in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:

[CODE_BLOCK_4]: contains a [CODE_BLOCK_5] object with empty [CODE_BLOCK_6].
A series of content blocks, each of which have a [CODE_BLOCK_7], one or more [CODE_BLOCK_8] events, and a [CODE_BLOCK_9] event. Each content block will have an [CODE_BLOCK_10] that corresponds to its index in the final Message [CODE_BLOCK_11] array.
One or more [CODE_BLOCK_12] events, indicating top-level changes to the final [CODE_BLOCK_13] object.
A final [CODE_BLOCK_14] event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of [CODE_BLOCK_15] events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```

```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple

We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an [CODE_BLOCK_16], which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error[CODE_BLOCK_17]
​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each [CODE_BLOCK_19] event contains a [CODE_BLOCK_20] of a type that updates the [CODE_BLOCK_21] block at a given [CODE_BLOCK_22].
​Text delta
A [CODE_BLOCK_23] content block delta looks like:
Text delta[CODE_BLOCK_24]
​Input JSON delta
The deltas for [CODE_BLOCK_26] content blocks correspond to updates for the [CODE_BLOCK_27] field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final [CODE_BLOCK_28] is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a [CODE_BLOCK_29] event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A [CODE_BLOCK_30] content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta[CODE_BLOCK_31]
Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from [CODE_BLOCK_33] at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an [CODE_BLOCK_34] key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple [CODE_BLOCK_35] events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.
​Raw HTTP Stream response
We strongly recommend that use our client SDKs when using streaming mode. However, if you are building a direct API integration, you will need to handle these events yourself.
A stream response is comprised of:

A [CODE_BLOCK_36] event
Potentially multiple content blocks, each of which contains:
a. A [CODE_BLOCK_37] event
b. Potentially multiple [CODE_BLOCK_38] events
c. A [CODE_BLOCK_39] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_40] event
A [CODE_BLOCK_41] event

There may be [CODE_BLOCK_42] events dispersed throughout the response as well. See Event types for more details on the format.

```
"stream": true
```
 to incrementally stream the response using server-sent events (SSE).
​Streaming with SDKs
Our Python and Type Script SDKs offer multiple ways of streaming. The Python SDK allows both sync and async streams. See the documentation in each SDK for details.

​Event types
Each server-sent event includes a named event type and associated JSON data. Each event will use an SSE event name (e.g.
```
event: message_stop
```
), and include the matching event
```
type
```
 in its data.
Each stream uses the following event flow:


```
message_start
```
: contains a
```
Message
```
 object with empty
```
content
```
.
A series of content blocks, each of which have a
```
content_block_start
```
, one or more
```
content_block_delta
```
 events, and a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event. Each content block will have an
```
index
```
 that corresponds to its index in the final Message
```
content
```
 array.
One or more
```
message_delta
```
 events, indicating top-level changes to the final
```
Message
```
 object.
A final
```
message_stop
```
 event.

​Ping events
Event streams may also include any number of
```
ping
```
 events.
​Error events
We may occasionally send errors in the event stream. For example, during periods of high usage, you may receive an
```
overloaded_error
```
, which would normally correspond to an HTTP 529 in a non-streaming context:
Example error
```
event: error
data: {"type": "error", "error": {"type": "overloaded_error", "message": "Overloaded"}}
```

​Other events
In accordance with our versioning policy, we may add new event types, and your code should handle unknown event types gracefully.
​Delta types
Each
```
content_block_delta
```
 event contains a
```
delta
```
 of a type that updates the
```
content
```
 block at a given
```
index
```
.
​Text delta
A
```
text
```
 content block delta looks like:
Text delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 0,"delta": {"type": "text_delta", "text": "ello frien"}}
```

​Input JSON delta
The deltas for
```
tool_use
```
 content blocks correspond to updates for the
```
input
```
 field of the block. To support maximum granularity, the deltas are partial JSON strings, whereas the final
```
tool_use.input
```
 is always an object.
You can accumulate the string deltas and parse the JSON once you receive a
```
content_block_stop
```
 event, by using a library like Pydantic to do partial JSON parsing, or by using our SDKs, which provide helpers to access parsed incremental values.
A
```
tool_use
```
 content block delta looks like:
Input JSON delta
```
event: content_block_delta
data: {"type": "content_block_delta","index": 1,"delta": {"type": "input_json_delta","partial_json": "{\"location\": \"San Fra"}}}
```

Note: Our current models only support emitting one complete key and value property from
```
input
```
 at a time. As such, when using tools, there may be delays between streaming events while the model is working. Once an
```
input
```
 key and value are accumulated, we emit them as multiple
```
content_block_delta
```
 events with chunked partial json so that the format can automatically support finer granularity in future models.

​Multiple conversational turns
The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don’t necessarily need to actually originate from Claude — you can use synthetic [CODE_BLOCK_3] messages.

​Putting words in Claude’s mouth
You can pre-fill part of Claude’s response in the last position of the input messages list. This can be used to shape Claude’s response. The example below uses
```
"max_tokens": 1
```
 to get a single multiple choice answer from Claude.

​Multiple conversational turns
The Messages API is stateless, which means that you always send the full conversational history to the API. You can use this pattern to build up a conversation over time. Earlier conversational turns don’t necessarily need to actually originate from Claude — you can use synthetic [CODE_BLOCK_3] messages.

​Creating a Message Batch

JSON
```
{
  "id": "msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF",
  "type": "message_batch",
  "processing_status": "in_progress",
  "request_counts": {
    "processing": 2,
    "succeeded": 0,
    "errored": 0,

  "cancel_initiated_at": null,
  "results_url": null
}
```

​Polling for Message Batch completion
To poll a Message Batch, you’ll need its
```
id
```
, which is provided in the response when creating request or by listing batches. Example
```
id
```
:
```
msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF
```
.

​Listing all Message Batches in a Workspace

Output
```
{
  "id": "msgbatch_013Zva2CMHLNnXjNJJKqJ2EF",
  "type": "message_batch",
  ...
}
{
  "id": "msgbatch_01HkcTjaV5uDC8jWR4ZsDV8d",
  "type": "message_batch",
  ...
}
```

​Retrieving Message Batch Results
Once your Message Batch status is
```
ended
```
, you will be able to view the
```
results_url
```
 of the batch and retrieve results in the form of a
```
.jsonl
```
 file.

Output
```
{
  "id": "my-second-request",
  "result": {
    "type": "succeeded",
    "message": {
      "id": "msg_018gCsTGsXkYJVqYPxTgDHBU",

      "id": "msg_01XFDUDYJgAACzvnptvVoYEL",
      "type": "message",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

​Canceling a Message Batch
Immediately after cancellation, a batch’s
```
processing_status
```
 will be
```
canceling
```
. You can use the same polling for batch completion technique to poll for when cancellation is finalized as canceled batches also end up
```
ended

​Creating a Message Batch

JSON[CODE_BLOCK_1]
​Polling for Message Batch completion
To poll a Message Batch, you’ll need its [CODE_BLOCK_3], which is provided in the response when creating request or by listing batches. Example [CODE_BLOCK_4]: [CODE_BLOCK_5].

​Listing all Message Batches in a Workspace

Output[CODE_BLOCK_6]
​Retrieving Message Batch Results
Once your Message Batch status is [CODE_BLOCK_8], you will be able to view the [CODE_BLOCK_9] of the batch and retrieve results in the form of a [CODE_BLOCK_10] file.

Output[CODE_BLOCK_11]
​Canceling a Message Batch
Immediately after cancellation, a batch’s [CODE_BLOCK_13] will be [CODE_BLOCK_14]. You can use the same polling for batch completion technique to poll for when cancellation is finalized as canceled batches also end up [CODE_BLOCK_15] and may contain results.
